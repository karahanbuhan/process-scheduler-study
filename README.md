# Process Scheduler Study

**process_scheduler_study** is a Python-based educational tool designed to simulate CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF Non-Preemptive, RR (Round Robin) and SRTF) for operating systems courses.
It allows users to input process details (PID, arrival time, burst time), select an algorithm, and specify a quantum for Round Robin.
The tool generates a Gantt Chart using Matplotlib and calculates waiting times and average waiting time to aid in studying scheduling concepts.

## Features

* Supports FCFS, SJF (Non-Preemptive), Round Robin and SRTF scheduling algorithms.
* Interactive Tkinter GUI for entering process details and algorithm selection.
* Random process generation for quick testing.
* Visualizes results with Gantt Charts and displays waiting times.
* Calculates average waiting time as a float (e.g., 5.4) and also in fraction format (e.g. 3/10).

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/process_scheduler_study.git
cd process_scheduler_study
```

## Install Dependencies and Run

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

This launches a Tkinter GUI where you can input processes, select an algorithm, and view the Gantt Chart and results.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of processes (1â€“10) in the GUI.
2. Provide PID, arrival time, and burst time for each process, or click **"Generate Random"** for automatic input.
3. Select an algorithm (**FCFS**, **SJF**, **RR** or **SRTF**) from the dropdown menu.
4. For **RR**, specify a quantum value.
5. Click **"Run"** to simulate and view the Gantt Chart, waiting times, and average waiting time.
